/**
 * the app's single import path into the design system: the published
 * components (re-exported from `./design-system`), plus the surface the app
 * needs that the design agent must never be handed —
 * `Form`/`RmxForm`/`useRmxForm` bind to react-router,
 * `FloatingField`/`FloatingInput` are the second field language (a property of
 * a field GROUP, never a control variant), and the rest are helpers that only
 * look like components to an extractor reading names off a barrel.
 *
 * `Tooltip` and `HoverCard` are flattened here like every other component, but
 * their PARTS are not: `./tooltip` and `./hover-card` both export `Arrow` and
 * `Content`, and a flat barrel can only hold one of each — so a caller needing
 * the parts takes the subpath, which is nearly all of them. `./masks` is
 * subpath-only outright, a namespace pair (`dollar`, `ein`) for that same
 * collision.
