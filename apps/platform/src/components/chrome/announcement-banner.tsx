/**
 * dismissible marketing announcement bar. the caller decides *whether* to
 * render it (chrome gate + suppress-on-target-page); it takes no styling
 * props.
 *
 * markup always renders — server included. a pre-paint script in the root
 * layout sets `<html data-banner-dismissed="ncnp-endorsement">` from the
 * localStorage key, and the arbitrary variant below empties the bar before it
 * ever paints. gating the first render on a mount effect would shift the
 * layout of every marketing page instead.
 *
 * both dismissal paths — react state and the css variant — act on the *inner*
 * container, never the outer one. callers place this as its own grid row
 * (see PublicLayout), and grid auto-placement assigns tracks to boxes: an
 * outer element that stopped generating a box would slide the header and
 * outlet up a track each. an empty outer element in an `auto` track is 0px,
 * which is what collapsing is supposed to mean here.
