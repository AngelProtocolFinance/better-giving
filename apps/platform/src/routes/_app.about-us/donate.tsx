/**
 * how the form is mounted here: better giving's own npo row (id 1), every
 * payment rail (`config: null` → `all_method_ids`), no session prefill.
 * `hide_bg_tip` mirrors the row's setting — the client prop is display-only,
 * the money path reads the row server-side.
 * `base_url` is the one piece that isn't static: it comes in as a prop from the
 * route loader (the request origin), so the post-payment return url lands on
 * the host the donor is actually on.
 * `hide_unavailable_express`: nobody lands here to donate, so an express rail
 * that can't be offered (adblocked paypal sdk, ineligible currency) drops out
 * quietly rather than throwing a modal over the page. mid-payment failures
 * still prompt here, same as everywhere.
 *
 * this mount is static where `/donate/1` reads the npo row: `config: null`
 * discards `increments`, `freq_opts` and `method_ids`, and
 * `donation_recipient_init` hardcodes `donor_address_required: false`. so
 * restricting bg's own row's donate methods, or turning on donor address, moves
 * `/donate/1` and leaves this band where it is. all display-only — the money
 * path reads the row server-side either way.
