/**
 * the sweep for depth picked by eye rather than spent by name.
 *
 * the elevation set (`packages/ui/src/styles/theme.css`) is four levels, a
 * recessed pair, three marketing lifts and one handle affordance, and a call
 * site spends exactly one of those names. `--shadow-*` and `--inset-shadow-*`
 * are reset to `initial` beside it, so `shadow-md` and `shadow-2xl` match no
 * rule — that is the structural half of the gate, and it ships with the app.
 *
 * ## what the structural reset cannot catch, which is why this file exists
 *
 * - **`shadow-[…]` never consults the theme.** an arbitrary value is compiled
 *   straight out of the bracket, so a hand-tuned `shadow-[0_2px_8px_#0003]`
 *   survives a closed namespace intact and paints a depth nothing else in the
 *   product has. resetting the namespace harder does not reach it; only reading
 *   the source does.
 * - **a stripped utility is silent.** `shadow-lg` after the reset produces no
 *   rule, no warning and no error — the element simply renders flat, which
 *   looks plausible in review. the reset stops the drift; it cannot tell anyone
 *   the class was written.
 * - **`shadow-none` still compiles**, from a literal rather than from the
 *   scale, so no reset reaches it. with the namespace closed there is nothing
 *   left for it to switch off but a named level, and a level that has to be
 *   cancelled at the call site is the wrong level for that call site.
 * - **a color modifier is a second decision.** `shadow-lift-cta
 *   shadow-primary/40` compiles fine — the lift's own tint is simply
 *   overwritten by a hand-picked one. the tint lives inside the token; a
 *   `shadow-<color>/<alpha>` written beside a name is the pair the three lift
 *   tokens exist to retire.
 * - **the `z-*` namespace is deliberately NOT reset**, so `z-10` and every
 *   other sibling-stacking value still compiles, as it should. the six named
 *   steps start at `--z-index-subbar: 20`, so 20-and-up is the elevation range
 *   and a raw number in it is a layer ordering itself against the ladder by
 *   luck — the `z-51` that used to shove a combobox over a dialog.
 *
 * `drop-shadow-*` is a sibling namespace, stays open, and is not a finding
 * here: `routes/unlock-us-donations/hero.tsx` lays white copy over a
 * photograph, where a filter follows the glyph outlines and a box-shadow
 * cannot. every needle below is anchored so the `-` in `drop-shadow` excludes
 * it structurally, rather than by a name on an exemption list.
 *
 * hence the `node` vitest project: the rest of the suite runs in browser mode,
 * which has no `node:fs`.
