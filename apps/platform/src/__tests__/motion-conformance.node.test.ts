/**
 * the sweep for speed picked by eye rather than spent by name.
 *
 * the motion set (`packages/ui/src/styles/theme.css`) is three speeds bound to
 * `duration-fast|base|slow` by @utility, tailwind's three curves with a role
 * each, and the two `--default-transition-*` keys that make the common case
 * unwritten. unlike every other foundation in this ledger it has **no
 * structural half**: there is no `--duration-*` theme namespace to reset, so
 * `duration-200` compiles no matter what the token file says, and this file is
 * the entire gate rather than the part the compiler cannot reach.
 *
 * ## what it reads for
 *
 * - **a raw duration.** `duration-200` and `duration-[250ms]` are a speed
 *   re-picked at a call site. the three named steps are the three values the
 *   product actually runs at; a fourth arrives silently, renders plausibly, and
 *   is in no ledger.
 * - **`ease-in-out` written out loud.** `--default-transition-timing-function`
 *   is bound to it, so the class is a no-op wherever it appears. worse than
 *   redundant: once it is scattered through the tree an explicit `ease-out`
 *   stops being legible as "this one enters", which is the whole distinction
 *   the keyframes are paired on. the house curve is written by writing nothing,
 *   the same way flush is written by writing no shadow.
 * - **an arbitrary curve.** `ease-[cubic-bezier(…)]` never consults the theme,
 *   so it survives any amount of closing and paints a motion nothing else in
 *   the product has.
 * - **an easing or a speed with no transition to modify.** this one is a real
 *   bug rather than drift: `ease-in-out` on an element with no `transition-*`
 *   modifies nothing and renders as a snap. two sites carried it — a static
 *   grid wrapper on the fundraiser page, and the cpf toggle's track, whose twin
 *   in `tip-field.tsx` had the `transition-colors` it was missing. neither
 *   produced an error, a warning or a visibly broken screen.
 *
 * the needles are anchored with `(?<![-\w])`, which is what keeps
 * `--duration-fast`, `transition-duration`, `--marquee-duration` and
 * `var(--ease-in)` out of the results without any of them being named on an
 * exemption list — a custom property is not a utility, and a raw
 * `transition: … var(--duration-slow) …` string is the correct spelling for the
 * two sites that cannot reach a utility.
 *
 * hence the `node` vitest project: the rest of the suite runs in browser mode,
 * which has no `node:fs`.
