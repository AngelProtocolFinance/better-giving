   * *because the trigger is address-independent*. It fires on volume from one
   * poster and never on anything about the address being applied for, so it
   * cannot answer "does this address exist" and is no oracle — the property to
   * protect is that the response never varies with the address, not that it is
   * identical to success. It reuses the bare 400 this action already returns
   * for a honeypot trip and for a malformed post, so it adds no new shape to
   * probe against.
   *
   * Do NOT "fix" this into a silent success: producing one means writing the
