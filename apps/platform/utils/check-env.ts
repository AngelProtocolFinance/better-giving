// `.env*` files are the configuration, the shell is whatever the launching
// terminal happened to carry, and an exported APP_SESSION_SECRET silently
// replacing .env.test's filler runs a whole suite against a real secret.

// declared keys are unset across the call and restored after. a declared key
// that no file supplies is simply absent from the result and falls back to the

// from the platform — resolves unchanged.
